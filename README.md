# NFL-QBM
Creating a New QB rating system as a Project

Using the raw NFL dataset from Advanced Sports Analytics, I analyzed quarterback production data from the 2021-2022 season.  I then studied the rating system used by the NFL (passer rating) and ESPN (QBR), and developed my own unique rating system, the QBM (quarterback metric).  I analyzed the production using MySQL, which I also used to develop the calculations for the new metric.  This was a great test for learning about how to set limitations for query returns (such as CASE statement and IFNULL).   I also created a presentation using Google Slides to showcase how I would present this data to stakeholders.
